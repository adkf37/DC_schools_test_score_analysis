# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### D-001 — Use Grade of Enrollment for Cohort Assignment
**Date:** 2026-04-25  
**Decision:** The cohort engine (`analyze_cohort_growth.py`) uses **Grade of Enrollment** (not Tested Grade/Subject) for cohort assignment.  
**Rationale:** Middle-school math cohorts can include students taking Algebra I or Pre-Algebra; using Tested Grade would split the cohort. Grade of Enrollment keeps the full enrolled cohort together.  
**Consequences:** Rows where `Tested Grade/Subject == "All"` are preferred over subject-specific sub-rows to avoid subset bias.

### D-002 — Minimum N = 10 for Cohort Transitions
**Date:** 2026-04-25  
**Decision:** Cohort transitions with fewer than 10 students in either the baseline or follow-up are excluded.  
**Rationale:** Small-sample percentages are noisy and can mislead policy decisions. OSSE itself suppresses cells with N < 10.  
**Consequences:** Some small schools or subgroups will have no cohort-growth values. This is expected and documented.

### D-003 — Suppressed Values Treatment
**Date:** 2026-04-25  
**Decision:** Cells marked `DS`, `N<10`, `<5%`, `>95%`, or similar OSSE suppression codes are treated as `NaN` and excluded from all growth calculations.  
**Rationale:** Re-identifying individual students from suppressed values would violate OSSE's data-use policy.  
**Consequences:** Suppressed-value rows are dropped; the processing report counts them.

### D-004 — Stuart-Hobson as Primary Validation Benchmark
**Date:** 2026-04-25  
**Decision:** The four manually computed Stuart-Hobson transitions (ELA/Math Gr6→Gr7 and Gr7→Gr8, 2022→2023) serve as the primary regression benchmark. All pipeline changes must preserve these within ±0.1 pp.  
**Rationale:** The manual spreadsheet (`StuartHobson_Manual_Growth_example.xlsx`) was independently verified and represents the gold-standard expectation.  
**Consequences:** Any pipeline refactor that shifts these values by >0.1 pp must be investigated and justified before merging.

### D-005 — Python Stack & Dependency Constraints
**Date:** 2026-04-25  
**Decision:** Python ≥ 3.9, pandas, openpyxl, Dash, and scipy are the approved dependencies. No additional ML or heavy-compute libraries without Lead approval.  
**Rationale:** Keeps the environment lightweight and reproducible for policy researchers who may run this on modest hardware.  
**Consequences:** Statistical tests are limited to classical frequentist tests available in scipy.

### D-006 — Two-Proportion Z-Test for Significance (Task 05)
**Date:** 2026-04-25  
**Decision:** A pooled two-proportion z-test (two-tailed, α = 0.05) is used to assess whether a cohort's proficiency rate changed significantly between baseline and follow-up. The test uses `scipy.stats.norm` to compute the p-value from the pooled z-statistic.  
**Rationale:** The z-test is the standard method for comparing two independent proportions when sample sizes are large enough. It is interpretable, reproducible, and available in scipy without additional dependencies.  
**Consequences:**  
- `cohort_growth_detail.csv` gains `p_value` (rounded to 4 dp) and `significant` (bool) columns.  
- `cohort_growth_summary.csv` gains `pct_significant_transitions` (% of transitions with p < 0.05).  
- No multiple-comparison correction is applied by default; `significant` is a screening flag, not a family-wise claim. See `docs/methods.md` for details.  
- Small school cohorts (N ≈ 145) have low power; a 7pp change at 33% baseline requires N ≈ 366 per group for significance. City-wide aggregations will see more significant results.  
- Proficient counts are reconstructed as `round(pct / 100 × total_count)` because OSSE files report percentages and totals but not always raw proficiency counts.
